                <p>
                    My academic interests include data science, where I work with data to find patterns and insights. 
                    I also enjoy software engineering because it involves solving problems and building useful tools. 
                    Human-computer interaction is another area I find interesting, as it focuses on making technology easier and more intuitive to use. 
                    I like exploring how these fields come together to improve both technology and user experiences.
