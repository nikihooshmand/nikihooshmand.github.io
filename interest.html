                <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    My academic interests include data science, where I work with data to find patterns and insights. 
                    I also enjoy software engineering because it involves solving problems and building useful tools. 
                    Human-computer interaction is another area I find interesting, as it focuses on making technology easier and more intuitive to use. 
                    I like exploring how these fields come together to improve both technology and user experiences.

                <p>
                    Reading books is something I enjoy as it opens up new perspectives and ideas.
                    I also like spending time at different cafes with friends, drinking coffee and chatting. 
                    Swimming is a favorite activity of mine because it helps me relax and clears my mind, all while enjoying the gentle flow of the water.
